## 🧩 Next Action for Max (Codex)

1. **Data-layer MVP PR**

   * Add `store.js` for shared game data (load/save/import/export via `localStorage`).
   * Create `data.html` with editor UI, schema validation, and ARIA status messages.
   * Include `docs/data/sample.json` as example schema.

## 🕹️ Notes

Run this before committing any future doc or workflow changes:

```powershell
npx --yes markdownlint-cli "**/*.md" --ignore node_modules --ignore "lychee/**"
```

If clean → commit, push, and let the devlog workflow handle the rest.
Setup is complete — from here we build the site itself.
