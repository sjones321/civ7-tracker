## ✅ Accomplishments

## ⚙️ Next Planned Phase

- Document how to integrate the new automation scripts into pre-commit hooks if needed.
- Capture a walkthrough video for the devlog flow checklist.

---

## 🧠 Reflection

Today’s focus was tightening the documentation feedback loop—automation scripts, checklists, and lint commands now share a single source of truth.
