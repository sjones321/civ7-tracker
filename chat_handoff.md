# 🧭 CIV7 Tracker — Handoff for Next Chat (Changelog Milestone Complete)

**Project phase:** Docs polish done → Wrap-up & continuous hygiene

**Current state (✅):**

- `CHANGELOG.md` added using **Keep a Changelog** + **SemVer**.
- MD024 configured per-file to allow repeated “### Added” across releases.
- Workflow Guide appended with **Wrap-up & Handoff Ritual** section.
- Pre-commit hook stable; logger `run-hook-log.bat` available; optional `HOOK_SELFTEST` path documented.

---

## What’s Already Complete

- Version badge sourced from `docs/site.json` (DOM-ready fetch).
- Markdown & HTML validation clean; CI green on docs.
- README Quick Links includes `CHANGELOG.md`.

## What to Do Next (choose one)

1) **Docs:** Add `CONTRIBUTING.md` (short, friendly; commit style and PR flow).  
2) **CI polish (optional):** Add a link checker step and/or HTML validator job.  
3) **Base UI:** Start the first content page scaffold using `docs/head-snippet.txt` + version badge slot.

> In a new chat, say **Load project bootstrap**, then name one objective from above.  
> To close any future chat neatly, say **Wrap up this task** and follow the prompts.

## Working Rules (from Workflow Guide)

- Prefer **Replacement Packs** with markers; use full-file replacements when safer.  
- Always supply a **Conventional Commit** message and **manual test steps**.  
- Keep beginner-friendly steps; avoid multi-topic sprawl per chat.  
- During docs, deliver **Markdown as downloadable files** to avoid formatting issues.

**Upload refresh (end of day):** run the one-up `project-file-sync.bat` to regenerate `project-file-updates\`, then upload the files listed in `MANIFEST.txt` to the project panel.
