# 🌓 Daily Summary — 2025-11-01

* Focus: finalized Learning Log helper scripts; corrected spacing (MD012/MD022 safe) and verified Stream Deck prompt workflow.
* Notable PRs/Commits: added four helper files (`tools/learninglog-append.*`, `tools/learninglog-append-prompt.*`).
* Notes: successfully generated clean multi-entry log; lint passes. Confirmed UTF-8 dash rendering.

## ⚙️ Next Planned Phase

* Tomorrow: resume work on Data Editor MVP with Max (Codex).
* Lucy + Steve: open a parallel learning chat to explore Cursor (“Bob”), test IDE basics, and establish a three-tool workflow (Lucy-Max-Bob).
* Goal: have Bob assist interactively while Max handles structured PR scaffolding.

## 🧠 Reflection

Today was about tightening the automation loop and proving the devlog and learninglog systems behave cleanly. Having a single-blank-newline rule makes future appends reliable. The workflow is finally predictable; next, we focus on learning inside an IDE.

## Task

Harden markdown linting and make the devlog writer emit lint-safe spacing so PRs don’t fail on MD022/MD032.

## Why

Markdownlint runs on the merge result of PR + main. If a devlog on main has bad spacing, unrelated PRs fail. We need CI to guard main and the devlog script to produce compliant blocks.

## Changes (must)

1. Workflow: run markdownlint on push and PR

```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]
```
