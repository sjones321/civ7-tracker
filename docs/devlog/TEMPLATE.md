## 📘 End-of-Day Summary Guide

Each daily file should follow this structure to stay markdownlint-clean.

- Only **one** top-level heading (`# 🌙 ...`).
- Use **dashes** (`-`) for list items.
- Keep **one blank line** between headings and content.
- Tag any code fences with a language (use `text` for plain content).
- Avoid bare URLs — use `<...>` or `[label](...)`.
