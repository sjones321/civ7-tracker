## End-of-Day Summary Guide

Each daily file should follow this structure to stay markdownlint-clean.

- Only one top-level heading ("# CIV7 Tracker — End of Day Summary").
- Use dashes ("-") for list items.
- Keep one blank line between headings and content.
- Tag any code fences with a language (use "text" for plain content).
- Avoid bare URLs — use "<...>" or "[label](...)" links.
