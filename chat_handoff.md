# 🧭 CIV7 Tracker — Handoff for Next Chat (Contributing Milestone Complete)

**Project phase:** Docs polish done → Wrap-up & continuous hygiene

**Current state (✅):**

- `CHANGELOG.md` added using **Keep a Changelog** + **SemVer**.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` added for solo-maintainer workflow.
- MD024 configured per-file to allow repeated “### Added” across releases.
- Workflow Guide updated with **Markdown Delivery & Formatting Policy** addendum.
- Pre-commit hook stable; logger `run-hook-log.bat` available; optional `HOOK_SELFTEST` path documented.

---

## What’s Already Complete

- Version badge sourced from `docs/site.json` (DOM-ready fetch).
- Markdown & HTML validation clean; CI green on docs.
- README Quick Links includes `CHANGELOG.md` and `CONTRIBUTING.md`.

## What to Do Next (choose one)

1) **CI polish (optional):** Add a link checker step and/or HTML validator job.
2) **Base UI:** Start the first content page scaffold using `docs/head-snippet.txt` + version badge slot.

> In a new chat, say **Load project bootstrap**, then name one objective from above.
> To close any future chat neatly, say **Wrap up this task** and follow the prompts.

## Working Rules (from Workflow Guide)

- Prefer **Replacement Packs** with markers; use full-file replacements when safer.
- Always supply a **Conventional Commit** message and **manual test steps**.
- Keep beginner-friendly steps; avoid multi-topic sprawl per chat.
- During docs, deliver **Markdown as downloadable files** or **canvas snippets** to avoid formatting issues.

<!-- START PACK: chat_handoff.md (Markdown delivery reminder) -->
<!-- Replace this block if the reminder text changes -->
### Markdown Delivery Reminder

- For **entire files**, ask for a **downloadable full-file replacement** (with `START FILE` and inner `START/END PACK` markers).
- For **partial edits**, ask for a **canvas Replacement Pack** with `<!-- START PACK: ... -->` / `<!-- END PACK: ... -->`.
- Avoid long Markdown in plain chat—copy/paste from canvas or download instead.
<!-- END PACK: chat_handoff.md (Markdown delivery reminder) -->

**Upload refresh (end of day):** run the one-up `project-file-sync.bat` to regenerate `project-file-updates\`, then upload the files listed in `MANIFEST.txt` to the project panel.
