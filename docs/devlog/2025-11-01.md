## Task

Harden markdown linting and make the devlog writer emit lint-safe spacing so PRs don’t fail on MD022/MD032.

## Why

Markdownlint runs on the merge result of PR + main. If a devlog on main has bad spacing, unrelated PRs fail. We need CI to guard main and the devlog script to produce compliant blocks.

## Changes (must)

1) Workflow: run markdownlint on push and PR

- In `.github/workflows/markdownlint.yml`:

  ```yaml
  on:
    push:
      branches: [ main ]
    pull_request:
      branches: [ main ]

# 🌓 Daily Summary

- Outcome: Will evaluate Vercel + Supabase for hosting and storage; alternative options include Firebase or Cloudflare Workers.
- Next: Begin new chat “Backbone — Hosting, Remote Storage, and Data Adapter” for architecture decisions.
