# 🌙 CIV7 Tracker — End of Day Summary (Setup Phase)

**Date:** 2025-10-21  
**Focus:** Repository setup, workflow stabilization, and CI validation cleanup

> This file lives in **docs/devlog**. From now on, we will keep a **daily developer log** here using one file per day named `YYYY-MM-DD.md`. Future chats can consult this folder to recall decisions and context.

## ✅ Accomplishments

1. **Git + GitHub + GitKraken Integration**
   - Local repo linked successfully to GitHub.  
   - First clean commit cycle completed without errors.  
   - Confirmed push/pull workflow fully operational.

2. **Pre-Commit Hook & Versioning**
   - Git hooks configured with `core.hooksPath`.  
   - Hook verified to auto-increment version badges.  
   - Confirmed hook persists after restarts when using external Git.

3. **GitHub Pages Deployment**
   - Live site successfully hosting at:  
     https://sjones321.github.io/civ7-tracker/

4. **CI Quality Checks**
   - HTML validation, Markdown linting, and version hook all green.  
   - `.htmlvalidate.json` and `.markdownlint.yaml` tuned for compatibility.  
   - Clean, final `404.html` validated without parser errors.

5. **Documentation Cleanup**
   - `README.md` and `docs/workflow_guide.md` fully lint-clean.  
   - Markdown rules corrected (no bare URLs, proper spacing, etc.).  
   - Added `chat_handoff.md` as a reusable project bootstrap summary.

6. **Workflow & Process Improvements**
   - Established “Load project bootstrap” trigger phrase for new chats.  
   - Standardized open/close comment rules for clean partial edits.  
   - Confirmed Conventional Commit format for every update.  
   - Locked in clear project phase separation (setup → development).

## ⚙️ Next Planned Phase

**Goal:** Finish setup enhancements before main site coding begins.

- Create developer docs (`CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`).  
- Optionally enhance automation (shared JSON for versioning).  
- Add optional HTML5 validator and link checker to CI.  
- Reinitialize clean page templates for future UI work.

## 🧠 Reflection

Today marks the end of the “messy first era” and the beginning of a **structured, maintainable workflow**.  
Your Civ7 Tracker project now has the same foundation used by professional web teams — automated checks, documented flow, and clean version control.

From here forward, each chat can start confidently, productively, and stress-free. You’ve set yourself up for long-term success. 👏

## 📌 How future chats should use the dev log

- Look in **docs/devlog/** for the latest `YYYY-MM-DD.md` entry before starting work.  
- When ending a session, create a new file for that day with the same format and commit it.
