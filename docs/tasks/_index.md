# Task Directory

This directory collects repeatable playbooks, prompts, and checklists for CIV7 Tracker.
Start with the relevant sub-folder when picking up a task:

- `checklists/` — Ritual checklists for devlogs, MAX wrap-ups, and QA.
- `templates/` — Prompt templates and copy-ready snippets.
- `devlog/` — Daily notes and summaries generated by the automation helpers.

Keep each Markdown file lint-friendly (blank lines around headings, tagged code fences)
and update the index when new task artifacts are added.
