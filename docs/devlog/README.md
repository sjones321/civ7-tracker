# CIV7 Tracker — Developer Log

This folder stores one daily summary per file, named `YYYY-MM-DD.md`.

## How to create today’s entry

- Double‑click `new-devlog-today.bat` (or run `new-devlog.ps1`).

- It creates/opens `docs/devlog/YYYY-MM-DD.md`, and adds a **Commit Digest** for today.

- Ask ChatGPT for a human summary and paste it into the file.

- Commit and push.

## Template

See `TEMPLATE.md` for the structure used by the script.
