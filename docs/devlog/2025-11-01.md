## Task
Harden markdown linting and make the devlog writer emit lint-safe spacing so PRs donâ€™t fail on MD022/MD032.

## Why
Markdownlint runs on the merge result of PR + main. If a devlog on main has bad spacing, unrelated PRs fail. We need CI to guard main and the devlog script to produce compliant blocks.

## Changes (must)

1) Workflow: run markdownlint on push and PR
- In `.github/workflows/markdownlint.yml`:
  ```yaml
  on:
    push:
      branches: [ main ]
    pull_request:
      branches: [ main ]
